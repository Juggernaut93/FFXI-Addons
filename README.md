# Lili's Addons
A collection of addons I wrote for Final Fantasy XI, compatible with the [Windower launcher](http://windower.net/).  

## NOTE:
As of 28/07/2021, I am on hiatus. I decided I want to take my life in a different direction and coding and FFXI are incompatible with that. Knowing myself, I might still come back eventually, but for now I'm determined not to. The content of this repo is as such to be considered abandoned, at least temporarily, but with no resume date in sight. Have fun and thanks for all the laughs.

Addons to fix issues on private servers:
- chatfix (fixes empty or garbled chat messages)
- menufix (fixes crash when opening the status menu)
- tellfix (fixes empty or garbled tell messages)

Utilities:
- clickfind (click to print mouse cursor position on screen)
- posfind (click to print character position on world map)
- mousehalo (makes your mouse cursor MUCH more visible. A bit facetious, but working.)

Complete addons:
- Smeagol: automatically use CP/XP rings (and gear).
- Dupefind: find identical items scattered across different inventory bags.
- Dramagen: the only and last parser you will ever need.
- Indi-Nope: removes graphical effect from Indi-Spells.
- Witness Protection: assigns random persistent names to characters and linkshells that appear on screen (anonymize your screen)
- Silt Tracker: track earnings of Silt and Beads in Escha/Reisenjima.  
- TPSReport: exports an XML list of current alliance members.
- special: makes you feel special.
- position_manager: frontend for the wincontrol plugin to set position and screen size per character. DO NOT USE THIS, download it from windower instead.
- statsearch: full text search of the gear you own, filtered (or not) by job. Need to know what pieces you can equip that have Magic Defense? Now you can.
- collector: display owned and missing items from an item set. Want to know how many reive capes you have? Pulse weapons? Llith drops?

Incomplete addons:
- Friendzone: automatically calls trusts over and over. A bit bugged but workable.
- SafeOboro: makes everybody around Oboro in Port Jeuno disappear, so that you don't have any risk whatsoever of trading to scammers. Might make the zone laggy.
- JobInit: like init.txt, but specific per character per job.
- kaomoji: minimal kaomoji support for ffxi (behaves like /shrug /tableflip and /unflip do on discord)
