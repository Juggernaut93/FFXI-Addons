#statsearch

**NOTE:** due to limitations of the extdata library of windower, statsearch is currently unable to read text from some items, mainly divergence weapons/necks and odyssey gear. This functionality is completely dependent on when or if windower will change the extdata library to return text values rather than just "path A" or "path B".
